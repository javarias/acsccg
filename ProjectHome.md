## Alma Common Software Component Code Generator ##

ACS is a complex framework, as it relates to the creation of new components, whether implemented in Java, C++ or Python, and is a very repetitive task of creating these components, so here is where code generator speeds up the development process by predefined metamodels, in this case, UML diagrams in a XMI 2.0 format standard, a Model Driven Code Generator (MDCG).

One of the main objectives of this project, is implement a Java component code generator for Alma Common Software, including IDL interfaces and CDB configurations. The generation will be based in UML diagramas according to the UML 2.0 standard specifications.

### What is ACS ###

The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is a joint project between astronomical organizations in Europe, North America, and Japan. ALMA will consist of at least 50 primary twelve meter antennas plus 4 12 meter and 12 7 meter antennas constituting the "compact array". They will be all operating in the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelength range, with baselines up to 10 km. It will be located at an altitude above 5000m in the Chilean Atacama desert.

The ALMA Common Software (ACS) provides a software infrastructure common to all partners and consists of a documented collection of common patterns in and of components, which implement those patterns. The heart of ACS is based on a distributed component model, with ACS components implemented as CORBA objects in any of the supported programmin languages. The teams responsible for the control system's development use ACS Components as the basis for control high level entities and for the implementation of devices such as an antenna mount control.
