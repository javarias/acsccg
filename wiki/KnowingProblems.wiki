#summary Knowing Problems in the code generation.

 * Since theres no order when the generator reads the model, must fix the IDL compiling order
in the Makefile following the the inheritance order, i.e.: first compile the `BasicAntenna`, then compile the `VertexAntenna` IDL (`VertextAntenna` is extended from `BasicAntenna`) files.

 * The common IDL file wich have common structs, channel names..etc... many structs have
other structs data types, for fix this, just reorder the structs in the common IDL file.
