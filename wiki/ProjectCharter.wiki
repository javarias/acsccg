#summary Project Charter for ACS Component Code Generation

= Project Charter  =

== Project Charter Purpose ==
This section describes the overall plan to be used by the ACS Component Code Generation  project, including deployment of the product.

== Definitions Acronyms and Abreviations ==

The next acronyms or abreviations are used in the document:

    * EMF : Eclipse Modeling Framework, a framework of Eclipse to create plug-ins, Eclipse Applications for code generation base in Model-Driven.
    * ACS : Alma Common Software, more info at ACS.
    * oWA : Open Architecture Ware, a free open architecture for code generation.
    * XMI : XML Metadata Interchange, standard for exchanging metadata information via Extensible Markup Language (XML).
    * UML : Unified Modeling Languag, is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering.
    * NC : Notification Channles of ACS. 

== Objectives  ==

ACS (Alma Common Software) could do with more automatically generated code. It should be possible to write software components that use the framework in an easier way than its done today. Having this in mind it's proposed a project that continues the thesis of NicolasTroncoso that accomplishes:

    * Code generation starting from a model UML.
    * Generate code for one of the ACS supported languages; in particular, Java.
    * Have a Standalone Code Generator
    * Inheritance support between generated and non-generated code. This is required to provide support for more complex models.
    * Notification Channels Support, defined in the model. 

== Roles and Responsibilities  ==

The project structure is embedded in the current ALMA project structure. Key members of the teams identified as critical to the project are:

    * AlexisTejeda (UCN) Developer, Deployment Manager, Requirements Reviewer, Architecture Reviewer, Configuration Manager, Change Control Manager .
