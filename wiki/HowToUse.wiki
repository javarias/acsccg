#summary How to use the generator

The usage of the code generator is pretty simple:

 * It is recommended to create a folder with 3 subfolders inside, a `generated` folder, a `model` folder and a `xmi` folder in which goes the exported XMI files from Magic-Draw.

 * Once the model is defined export the model in : `Eclipse UML2 (v2.x) XMI FILE` export menu in Magic-Draw.

 * Build the binary.

 * Run the generator specifying the model path (XMI), profile file path andthe path for the code to generate: 
----
{{{
java -jar acsComponentCodeGenerator.jar -m /my/very/path/to/MyProject.uml -p  /my/very/path/to/Alma.profile.uml -o /user/home/MyProject/generated/folder [options]
}}}
----
 * In the project code page, they are 6 examples of models, image models, XMI, generated code (tested), ready to download and run, each example represents a feature of the generator.

 * Update the make file, see the KnownProblems section.
